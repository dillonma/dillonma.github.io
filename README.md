This is a *demonstration repository* for students [Advanced GIS](https://ges.umbc.edu/giscience-certificate/) and [GIS MPS](https://professionalprograms.umbc.edu/geographic-information-systems/masters-of-professional-studies-geographic-information-systems/) students for their own portfolios. 

This `README.md` file is mainly useful for me as a place to put resources.
